    <h1>Rakesh Gopal Karadi does 
        Chekov tonight</h1>
     <h6>Uncle Vanya  Anton Chekov</h6> 
     <p><h6>SEREBRAKOFF.</h6> <p>[Rousing himself]</p><p></p> Who is here? Is it you, Sonia?</p>

        <h6>HELENA.</h6> <p>It is I.</p>
        
        <h6>SEREBRAKOFF.</h6> <p>Oh, it is you, Nelly. This pain is intolerable.</p>
        
        <h6>HELENA.</h6> <p>Your shawl has slipped down. [She wraps up his legs in the
        shawl] Let me shut the window.</p>
        
        <h6>SEREBRAKOFF.</h6> <p>No, leave it open; I am suffocating. I dreamt just now that
        my left leg belonged to some one else, and it hurt so that I woke. I
        don't believe this is gout, it is more like rheumatism. What time is it?</p>
        
        <h6>HELENA.</h6><p> Half past twelve.</p> <p>[A pause.] </p>
        
        <h6>SEREBRAKOFF.</h6> <p>I want you to look for Batushka's works in the library
        to-morrow. I think we have him.</p>
        
        <h6>HELENA.</h6> <p>What is that? </p>
        
        <h6>SEREBRAKOFF.</h6><p> Look for Batushka to-morrow morning; we used to have him, I
        remember. Why do I find it so hard to breathe?</p>
